# Trainer’s Guide to Predictors

## What is this guide?

This guide is a support document for DHIS2 Academy trainers for the session "Predictors" This session follows the standard Academy training approach with 

1. a live demo session where the trainer demonstrate and explain the features, and 
   
2. a hands-­on session with exercises where participants get to practice the same features.

This guide will help the trainer​ prepare​​ for the live demo session. The “Live Demo step by step” section has a detailed walkthrough of all the steps to demonstrate with explanations and screenshots that should be easy to follow. Use that when preparing for the live demo session.

There is also a Quick Guide which lists the steps very briefly and this is meant as a lookup guide or “cheatsheet” WHILE doing the demo, to help the trainer remember all the steps and the flow of the demo.

## Learning objectives for this session

1. Define what a predictor is in DHIS2
2. Identify examples of when predictors can be used
3. Create outputs using predicted values
4. Create predictors in the mainteance app
5. Generate predicted values

## Live Demo step by step

### Create a visualiztion using predicted and non-predicted data in data visualizer

#### STOP - Perform Exercise 1

### Create supports for the predictor in the maintenance app

#### Create a new data element to store the predicted value

#### Create a data set in which to store this value

#### STOP - Perform Exercise 2

### Create the predictor in the maintenance app

#### Explain the predictor and define each of the fields within the predictor app

#### Run through an example in which you use 1.5 x the average of the last 3 weeks to generate the predictor

#### Show them that no values exist for the data element you made via data entry

#### Run the predictor

#### Show the results in data data entry

#### STOP - Perform Exercise 3

### Review the process of creating indicator groups and group sets in maintenance

### Run through an example in which you use 3 stddev above the mean for the last 11 weeks

#### Run the predictor

#### Show the results in data data entry

#### STOP - Perform Exercise 4

### Explain connection of predicted values to analytics and use the created predictors in visualizer

#### STOP - Perform Excercise 5
